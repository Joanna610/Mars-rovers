# Mars-rovers

Project was created based on code shared by course leader. All folders was added by course leader. Files that was fully ready and in which I was not commit changes were: "lancze_do_gnuplota.hh", "lancze_do_gnuplota.cpp", "PowierzchniaMarsa.hh", "PowierzchniaMarsa.cpp", "TypKolizji.hh", "Kolory.hh" and also some other files that was only the beginning of program.

The main task was to implement the movement of three Mars rovers, based on object-oriented programming. Files I created first was implementation the class Vectors and Matrix to enable the rovers to calculate their movements. They can make a move based on given distance and also rotate to change the path. I was added the rocks to list to be show on platform and implement algorithm to detect the collision with different objects. The rovers can also pass over the rocks.
