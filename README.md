# Mars-rovers

The project was created based on code shared by the course leader. All folders were added by the course leader. Files that were provided and have not been changed from the beginning are: "loncze_do_gnuplota.hh", "loncze_do_gnuplota.cpp", "PowierzchniaMarsa.hh", "PowierzchniaMarsa.cpp", "TypKolizji.hh", "Kolory.hh" and also some other files that was only the beginning of program.

The main task was to implement the movement of three Mars rovers using object-oriented programming. Firstly, I implemented the classes Vectors and Matrix to enable the rovers to calculate their movements. They can make a move based on the given distance and also rotate to change the path. I have added the list of rocks to be shown on the platform and implemented a collision detection algorithm. The rovers also have the ability to pass over the rocks.
